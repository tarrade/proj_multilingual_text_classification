# How to run the code
Here you can find some basics information on how to run the code

or  [(on GCP)](creation_ai_platform_notebook.md)
- Anaconda python environment installed with all needed python packages [(conda env)](conda_env.md)

Then you need to create environment variables, activate Anaconda python

First you need to have:
- Anaconda python environment installed with all needed python packages [(conda env)](conda_env.md)

Then you need to create environment variables, activate Anaconda python
